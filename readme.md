## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project on your local system:

1. *Install Required Libraries*:
   Ensure Python is installed, then run:
   bash
   pip install pymysql
   

2. *Set Up MySQL Database*:
   - Open MySQL and create a database named user.
   - Create the required table using the following SQL script:
     sql
     CREATE TABLE table1 (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100),
         age INT,
         pin INT,
         state VARCHAR(100),
         gender VARCHAR(10),
         balance INT DEFAULT 0,
         account_no BIGINT UNIQUE
     );
     

3. *Update Database Credentials*:
   Replace the database connection details in the Python code:
   python
   connection = pymysql.connect(
       host="localhost",
       user="root",
       password="your_password",  # Replace with your MySQL password
       database="user"
   )
   

4. *Run the Application*:
   - Save the Python script to a file, e.g., bank_system.py.
   - Execute the file:
     bash
     python bank_system.py
